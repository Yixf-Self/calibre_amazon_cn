Calibre Metadata Source Plugin for Amazon.cn
=========

This plugin allows Calibre to read book information from Amazon.cn when you choose to download/fetch metadata. Calibre currently comes with plugins for a number of information sources such as Amazon and Googlebooks. Adding this plugin can potentially increase both the success rate and quality of information retrieved for some of your Chinese books.

### Main Features of v0.3.0
This plugin can retrieve amazon_cn id, title, author, comments, rating, publisher, publication date, language, tags and covers from Amazon.cn. The amazon_cn id will also be displayed in the book details panel as "Amazon.cn" to be clicked on and taken directly to the website for that book.

### Special Notes:
* Requires Calibre 0.8 or later.
* No ISBN information for kindle books can be retrieved from Amazon.cn since almost all chinese kindle books have no ISBN information.

### Installation Notes:
Download the zip file and install the plugin as described in the Introduction to plugins thread.
Note that this is not a GUI plugin so it is not intended/cannot be added to context menus/toolbars etc.

### Paypal Donations:
If you find this plugin useful please feel free to show your appreciation. I have spent many unpaid hours in its development and support so any encouragement for me to continue is appreciated!
