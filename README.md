Calibre Metadata Source Plugin for Amazon.cn
=========

This plugin allows Calibre to read book information from Amazon.cn when you choose to download/fetch metadata. Calibre currently comes with plugins for a number of information sources such as Amazon and Googlebooks. Adding this plugin can potentially increase both the success rate and quality of information retrieved for some of your chinese books.

### Main Features of v0.1.0
This is a beta version.
Can retrieve amazon_cn id, title, author, comments, rating, publisher, publication date, language and covers
The amazon_cn id will also be displayed in the book details panel to be clicked on and taken directly to the website for that book.

### Special Notes:
Requires Calibre 0.8 or later.

### Installation Notes:
Download the zip file and install the plugin as described in the Introduction to plugins thread.
Note that this is not a GUI plugin so it is not intended/cannot be added to context menus/toolbars etc.

### Paypal Donations:
